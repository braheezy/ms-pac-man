# ms-pacman Game Development Roadmap

## Step 1: Project Setup and Ebiten Installation

1. Set up a new Go project directory for ms-pacman.
2. Install Ebiten by following the installation instructions provided on the official Ebiten GitHub repository.

## Step 2: Create the Game Window

1. Initialize the Ebiten game loop to create a window for the game.
2. Set the game window properties, such as title, size, and resizable options.

## Step 3: Load Game Assets

1. Prepare the game assets, including sprites, sound effects, and background images.
2. Implement a mechanism to load these assets into the game.

## Step 4: Define Game Entities

1. Define the ms-pacman character with its properties, such as position, direction, and lives.
2. Define the ghost characters with their unique properties and behavior.
3. Create the game maze as a grid, where each cell represents a tile with walls or pellets.

## Step 5: Implement Player Controls

1. Handle keyboard inputs to control ms-pacman's movement.
2. Make sure ms-pacman can navigate through the maze and avoid walking through walls.

## Step 6: Ghost AI

1. Develop the AI for the ghost characters to pursue ms-pacman intelligently.
2. Define different ghost behaviors, such as chasing, patrolling, or retreating when ms-pacman eats power pellets.

## Step 7: Pellet Interaction

1. Implement collision detection between ms-pacman and pellets.
2. Determine the scoring system and update the score when ms-pacman consumes pellets.

## Step 8: Power Pellets and Ghost Vulnerability

1. Implement power pellets in the maze that grant temporary invincibility to ms-pacman.
2. Define a vulnerable state for the ghosts when ms-pacman eats a power pellet.

## Step 9: Game Logic and State

1. Develop the game logic to handle win/lose conditions.
2. Implement game states, such as start screen, game over, and level transitions.

## Step 10: User Interface

1. Create user interface elements, including score display, lives counter, and level indicator.
2. Design and implement UI screens for game start, win, and game over scenarios.

## Step 11: Audio

1. Integrate sound effects for ms-pacman movement, pellet consumption, and ghost interactions.
2. Add background music during gameplay and on UI screens.

## Step 12: Testing and Debugging

1. Test the game thoroughly to identify and fix bugs and issues.
2. Optimize performance if needed to ensure smooth gameplay.

## Step 13: Polish and Finalization

1. Review and refactor the code to improve maintainability and readability.
2. Polish the user interface, graphics, and audio for a better gaming experience.

## Step 14: Deployment

1. Package the game for distribution on the desired platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux).
2. Publish the game on relevant distribution platforms or share it with the target audience.

By following this roadmap, we will be able to develop a functional and enjoyable ms-pacman game using the Go game engine Ebiten. Remember to keep the code modular and well-documented throughout the development process. Happy coding!



To create a coordinate system that is sensible to the tile size you are using, you can define a helper function that converts tile coordinates to pixel coordinates and vice versa. This way, you can work with tile coordinates throughout the program without directly thinking about pixels or the specific tile size.

Here's how you can achieve this:

    Define the tile size as a constant in your code:

go

const TileSize = 32 // Assuming each tile is 32x32 pixels

    Create a helper function to convert tile coordinates to pixel coordinates:

go

func TileToPixel(tileX, tileY int) (pixelX, pixelY int) {
	pixelX = tileX * TileSize
	pixelY = tileY * TileSize
	return pixelX, pixelY
}

    Create another helper function to convert pixel coordinates to tile coordinates:

go

func PixelToTile(pixelX, pixelY int) (tileX, tileY int) {
	tileX = pixelX / TileSize
	tileY = pixelY / TileSize
	return tileX, tileY
}

With these helper functions in place, you can now work with tile coordinates in your program without worrying about pixel values or tile size:

go

// Example usage:

tileX := 5
tileY := 5

pixelX, pixelY := TileToPixel(tileX, tileY)
fmt.Printf("Tile (%d, %d) is at pixel (%d, %d)\n", tileX, tileY, pixelX, pixelY)
// Output: Tile (5, 5) is at pixel (160, 160)

// You can also do the reverse conversion:
newTileX, newTileY := PixelToTile(pixelX, pixelY)
fmt.Printf("Pixel (%d, %d) corresponds to tile (%d, %d)\n", pixelX, pixelY, newTileX, newTileY)
// Output: Pixel (160, 160) corresponds to tile (5, 5)

By using these helper functions, you can seamlessly work with tile coordinates and abstract away the pixel details, making it easier to reason and reference tiles throughout your Pacman game code.

The current logic checks tiles for movement and stops moving when a wall tile is detected. Instead of stopping, more granular logic should run that allows movement unless there's a pixel collision with the wall. A pixel collision can be determined by checking for non-black pixels, which means it's a wall. No masks need to be created because the tile images are already setup for it (black means good).
